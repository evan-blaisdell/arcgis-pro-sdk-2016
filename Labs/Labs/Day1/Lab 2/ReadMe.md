##Lab 2: Conditions and States 

The ArcGIS Pro framework incorporates a mechanism for triggering the activation of customizations based on user defined conditions. This is provided using the states and conditions DAML constructs. States and conditions provide a simple means for expressing when various GUI elements such as ribbon tabs, dock panes, buttons and tools should and shouldnâ€™t be visible or enabled within the application. Read here for more about [Conditions and States](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/proconcepts-framework#conditions-and-state). Refer to [ProGuide: Code Your Own States and Conditions](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProGuide-Code-Your-Own-States-and-Conditions).


#####In this lab you will learn how to
* Use DAML conditions and states
* Implement a Delegate Command

You are going to be adding a new button to the Add-in Tab that toggles on or off a custom state that you will define in your Config.daml. That custom state will be associated with a custom condition (that you will also define in your DAML). The custom condition will be associated with the two tab groups you previously defined in **Lab 1**. When the state is activated it will flip the custom condition to **true** and the tab groups should become visible. When the state is deactivated the custom condition will be **false** and the tab groups will be hidden.

Note: It is suggested that you **_delete_** the Add-in from Lab1 to avoid confusion between the tabs and tab groups defined in _that_ Add-in and the duplicate tabs and tab groups copied to Lab 2. To delete the Add-in go to your `C:\Users\<your username>\Documents\ArcGIS\AddIns\ArcGISPro` and delete all its contents

####Step 1: Open the Lab2 Start Project
* Open Visual Studio and select Open Project.  
* Navigate to your `Labs\Day1\Lab 2\Start` folder (should be at `C:\ProSDKWorkshop\arcgis-pro-sdk-workshop-2day-master\Labs\Day1\Lab 2\Start`) and open the ConditionsAndState.sln.
* Notice that the DAML defining the Favorites tabs and associated tab groups from Lab1 is already included in your Config.daml.

####Step 2: Define a Custom Condition and State

Define the custom condition and the state in the config.daml. Insert the following xml into the Config.daml. It should be pasted within the `<conditions>...</conditions>`above the modules element.  This will create a new condition called "example_state_condition" and a state called "example_state".

```xml
<conditions>
	<!-- our custom condition -->
	<insertCondition id="example_state_condition" caption="Example state">
		<!-- our condition is set true or false based on this underlying state -->
		<state id="example_state" />
	</insertCondition>
</conditions>

```  

Add a condition attribute to both the tab elements in the Config.daml: `<tab id="..." condition="example_state_condition" ...>`.

####Step 3: Add a New Button to the Config.daml

We are going to add the button DAML by hand. Find the `<controls>...</controls>` element and define a new button in DAML or you can simply copy/paste the button definition below.

```xml
<button id="working_with_DAML_ToggleStateButton" caption="ToggleStateButton " 
	className="" 
	smallImage="Images\GenericButtonBlue16.png" largeImage="Images\GenericButtonBlue32.png">
	  <tooltip heading="Tooltip Heading">Toggle state<disabledText /></tooltip>
</button>
```

Notice that the **className** attribute is _empty_. You need to <u>**fill this in**</u> using the convention `<module id>:<method name>`.

We will be adding a static method to the Module class called `ToggleState` in the next step. We must reference that method in the button className attribute prefixed with the Module id and a colon "<b>:</b>". Assuming you are using the starter project Module Id as-is: `Lab2_start_ConditionsAndState`, the className attribute would be:

```xml
<button ... className="Lab2_start_ConditionsAndState:ToggleState" ... />

```

Ensure that your className attribute content _exactly_ matches your Module id and static method name.

Add a button reference to your new ToggleState button. Locate the  group with id `"Lab2_start_Group1"` to add the button into.

```xml
<button refID="working_with_DAML_ToggleStateButton"/>
```

####Step 4: Implement the Delegate Command method

Open Module1.cs. Add in your static Delegate Command method. It must return void. Call it ToggleState.

```
internal static void ToggleState() {

}
```

State is activated and deactivated programatically using the `FrameworkApplication.State` property. Whenever the button is pressed it should toggle the state activation. Your implementation should look something like this:

```c#
internal class Module1 : Module
{
 ...
 
private static readonly string MyStateID = "example_state";
internal static void ToggleState()
{
	if (FrameworkApplication.State.Contains(MyStateID))
	{
		FrameworkApplication.State.Deactivate(MyStateID);
	}
	else
	{
		FrameworkApplication.State.Activate(MyStateID);
	}
}

```    

Make sure that the state id in the code matches the state id name you chose in your Config.daml.

* Compile the Add-In and run the sample. Click the Toggle State button. The Example State Tab group will be visible. Click the Toggle State button again to hide the Example State Tab group.
